# Research Summary
In this resaerch we learn how to make a basic response robot. Personally, I think it can be devided in to three major parts whitch are: Identify user intent, entity extraction, and response. During the research, we learn different method to deal with these problems.



# Project Summary
The main aim of the project is to design a robot whitch user can cummunicate with. The content of communication is concentrated on the information of the stocks. In this project we utilize python and telegram bot to achieve this goual. The robot is to be able to extract and analyze the content of the sentense and giving correspond answer. Watch the Demo video to gain more information.



# Code explimation
I explain the fuction of each part of code in the code. Open the main.py to gain more information



# Shortcomings 
The robot is not a complete version of a communication robot. Due to school work, I do not have enough time to make a fully functional robot. As the result, this rebot only can recongnize apple and google's stock. As for the information, it only can gives information about highest price and current price. Due to I'm not good at use rasa. I do not construct training data and use rasa. If possible, I will keep update my robot in future
